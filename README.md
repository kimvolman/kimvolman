Hi, I’m [Kim Volman](https://kimvolman.com/)

I’m a pharmacy leader and healthcare strategist with hands-on experience in pharmacy operations, long-term care, and specialty pharmacy environments. My background as a pharmacist shapes how I approach leadership, system design, and innovation in highly regulated healthcare settings.

I focus on building scalable, patient-centered pharmacy operations by aligning people, processes, and technology. Over the years, I’ve worked on initiatives involving operational optimization, quality improvement, compliance, and the responsible adoption of new technologies. I’m particularly interested in how healthcare systems can evolve without compromising safety, ethics, or clinical judgment.

My work often sits at the intersection of healthcare operations and strategy—where practical execution matters just as much as long-term vision. I value clear communication, accountability, and continuous improvement, especially in environments where small decisions can have significant patient impact.
